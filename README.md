## Git stuff
Hi, please set up git on your laptop to start working!

### Setting up git on terminal
1. Set up your account
```
$ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
$ git config --global user.email "your email"
```

2. Pull the project to a location of your choice (try if okay there might be some authority issue)
```
$ cd myDir
$ git clone https://github.com/vanessay1309/FYP-demo
```
3. You can now start working


### Everytime you work on the project
1. check if there is any new update
```
$ git pull
```

2. Work on the Project

3. Upload you updates
```
$ git add *
$ git commit -m "CommitMessage i.e LayoutChange"
$ git push origin master
